#summary A description of how to create Pentaho chart XML for PentahoFlashCharts

= XML Templates =

Starting with PentahoFlashChart 0.2.x and higher, the method to create charts for Open Flash Chart has changed.  While previously you created the OFC1.0 template and PFC did replacements, the JSON object model of OFC2.0 makes that approach nearly impossible.  

This document covers how to use Pentaho's existing [http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/ServerDoc2x/Chart+Properties+Reference Chart Definition XML] to create flash charts in Pentaho.

= Example = 

At a very basic level, the PentahoFlashChart component will do precisely what the PentahoChartComponent does, except it will output an OFC HTML Fragment along with a JSON text file.  

For example, using the chart XML resource:

{{{
<chart>
 <chart-type>BarChart</chart-type>
 <title>Sales Title</title>
</chart>
}}}

with the data

||Product||Amount||
||VCR||2981.21||
||DVD||8389.89||

Will produce the OFC JSON output

{{{

{
  "title":{
    "text":  "Sales Title"
  },
  "elements":[
    {
      "type":      "bar",
      "text":      "Amount",
      "values" :   [2981.21,8389.89]
    }
  ],
  "x_axis":{
    "labels":      ["VCR", "DVD"]
  }
}

}}}
