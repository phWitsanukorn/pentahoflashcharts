**This project is no longer offering downloads / code to do flash charts in Pentaho.**

## Pentaho Flash Chart Component ##
Pentaho branched the code (early on) and has their own codeline.  The PentahoFlashChart component that comes with your Pentaho BI Server comes from here:
svn://source.pentaho.com/svnroot/bi-platform-v2/trunk/bi-platform-plugins-actions/src/org/pentaho/platform/plugin/action/

Pentaho and PFC developers are no longer doing development on the component.  They are "End of Life" and frozen.

## Chart Beans ##
Pentaho is working on Chart Beans as the future path for charting (regular, flash, etc).  Check out the project here:
